Our research focuses on applications and extensions of latent variable modeling (factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM)), multilevel modeling (MLM), missing data and meta-analysis. One particular research interest is in the design and analysis of data from planned missing data designs. 

We are also interested in developing programs that institute advanced methods in a user friendly  manner with the statistical language R.
