Welcome to our lab blog. We'll use the blog to provide updates on new research/software inovations coming out of our lab.

Our paper discussing power analysis for mediation models and our app to perform these power calculations has been published at *Social Psychology and Personality Science*, to see a draft of the article take a look at the [app page](http://marlab.org/power_mediation/).

We have updated the app to include a serial mediation model with two serial mediators.
