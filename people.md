Dr. Schoemann's general interests in quantitative psychology lie in the areas of latent variable modeling (factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM)), multilevel modeling (MLM), and meta-analysis. Across these areas he has focused on issues related to multiple group models, missing data, longitudinal models, and Monte Carlo simulations. He is interested in encouraging access to advanced quantitative techniques through developing programs in the statistical language R.
