[Determining power and sample size for indirect effects]()
Shiny app to determine power and sample size for simple mediation models. Download the .zip file, extract to a folder and run the run_app.R file to start the app. COMING SOON: web based version of the app.

[simsem](simsem.org) [(R package)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simsem/index.html)
An R package designed to act as a comprehensive simulator for structural equation models. simsem can generate and analyze simulated data and simsem includes advanced simulation functions including missing data, non-normal data, and continuously varying simulation parameters.

[semTools](https://github.com/simsem/semTools/wiki) [(R package)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/semTools/index.html)
An R package with the goal of collecting useful R functions related to structural equation modeling. All users of R (or SEM) are invited to submit functions or ideas for functions.

[Plotting power curves for RMSEA ](http://quantpsy.org/rmsea/rmseaplot.htm)
An online utility to create a plot of power for RMSEA against a range of sample sizes.

R function to orthogonalize indicators for latent variable interactions
An R function that will take a data set and create orthogonalized product terms to compute latent variable interactions. Currently available in the [semTools](https://github.com/simsem/semTools/wiki) R package
